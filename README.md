## an Utility to meassure your productivity


</div>

### Description

Sorry, Previously I forgot the .frx files, now included.

From the Author:

This is Just an Utility I made to meassure how much time I spend doing what things...

So I will be able to improve my own productivity...

I also added a kind of Schedule.

This Utility has several codes which I downloaded from PSC, so credit to who ever made

them...This is just a way to give back what has been given to me by PSC.

Read the file From the Author.txt for further info.
