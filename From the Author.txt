From the Author:

This is Just an Utility I made to meassure how much time I spend doing what things...
So I will be able to improve my own productivity...
I also added a kind of Schedule.

This Utility has several codes which I downloaded from PSC, so credit to who ever made 
them...This is just a way to give back what has been given to me by PSC.

Ok, so Just Compile the application and Run...
It will add an Icon to the SysTray, and the main window will appear...
Several preentered tasks show in the main window...double click on one to start a task...Say whenever you start checking your email, dblclick on the Checking Emails task, and when you are done "End" the task...an so on with anything you do...
You can add tasks to suit your own needs, at the end of the day, clik on the Report Button
that way a report of the current day will be made, which you can save to a textfile...
The database contains several tasks already, so just click on the report button, to check and see how it works...

Originally the Code is made for test purposes, so that every 30 seconds, the Task Monitor will tell you how much time you have already spent on the current task. To chance that go to the Prod.cls class...
Inside the ChkTask Procedure, there are instructions to change the code so the message will appear after every 30 minutes....

So Compile and enjoy :)

Note: If you want to Clear the database, make sure you delete all records, BUT the one with id=0...or else you will get errors :)

Stay tunned for my next post...
